It will give real time status of route and possible <strong>deviation</strong> of standard route in term of red (danger), amber (use caution, there might be possible danger) or green (every thing is good). It will also tell how far is your destination and how much you already traveled. Any time driver will take any <strong>wrong</strong> route you will come to know immediately.
